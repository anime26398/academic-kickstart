I am a final year CS undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I am broadly in Deep Learning, with applications in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. At IIT Roorkee, I am the chairperson of a Computer Science-centric discussion group named the [ACM IIT Roorkee Students Chapter](https://iitr.acm.org).

I will be working as a full time researcher at Adobe Big Data Labs, Bangalore, India from August 2020. Prior to this, I worked on Neural Video compressions and Action Recognition with the Adobe Big Data Lab in Bangalore. I also collaborated with [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://bbanerjee.netlify.app/), working on Remote Sensing (RS) image Analysis.
