I am working on automatic report generation of chest X-rays as a part of my Bachelor Thesis Project. I am being advised by [Prof. Marco Pedersoli](http://profs.etsmtl.ca/mpedersoli/), [Prof. Jose Dolz](https://josedolz.github.io/) and [Prof. Balasubramanina Raman](http://faculty.iitr.ac.in/~balarfma/)for this project. We have established and coded baselines on the IU-XRAY dataset and are currently working on a transformer-based model.
