  title = "Research Intern"
  company = "Adobe, India"
  company_url = "https://www.adobe.com/in/"
  location = "Bangalore, India"
  date_start = "2019-05-06"

  description = """
  Worked at Adobe Big Data Labs, Bangalore:
  
  * Developed a task-aware neural video compression algorithm or action recognition by jointly minimizing both construction and action prediction loss.
  * Designed a pipeline to achieve reduced-binarized embedding for RGB-videos, with adjustable compression factor, achieving maximum compression greater than standard mpeg4 compression.
  * Achieved very low inference time on standard video action recognition datasets like, UCF101, HMBD51, MERL, with very low computation (both GPU memory and CPU RAM) required as compared to SOTA action recognition models on RGB videos.
  * Used the trained compression-action-recognition model for designing query-answering model for retail-store video analytics over Edge-devices.

  description = """
  Worked remotely as a intern with Prof. Biplab Banerjee:
  * Evaluated the potential of SAR and optical imagery in crop identification for an Indian region using multi-class classification based on the support vector machine (SVM) and Autoencoders with Auxillary Loss applied to the temporal features.
  * The experiments are conducted for Kharif and Rabi crop cycles with major crops in the region of interest.
  * The experiments suggest that the joint use of optical and radar imagery results in better classification accuracy compared to using them individually.
  * A paper for the same was accepted for publication in IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2019.
